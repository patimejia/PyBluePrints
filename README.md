## Why is File Structure Important?

A well-organized file structure is crucial for any software project. It makes your code easier to understand, navigate, and maintain. Following best practices for file structure ensures consistency across projects, which can be especially helpful when **collaborating** with others or when you revisit your project after some time.

## Best Practices

Some best practices for organizing Python projects include:

- Separating source code and test code into different folders.
- Using meaningful and descriptive names for files and folders.
- Including a `README.md` file to provide an overview and usage instructions.
- Adding a `LICENSE` file to specify the terms under which the project can be used.
- Grouping related files together, such as scripts for different project structures.

## Installation

You can install PyBlueprintMaker via `pip`:

```bash
pip install PyBlueprintMaker
```

## Usage

To use PyBlueprintMaker, run the following command:

`PyBlueprintMaker [output_path] [structure]`

Where output_path is the desired output path for the project structure and structure is the project structure to create. The supported structures are basic, intermediate, advanced, extended, or modular.

For example, to create a basic project structure in a folder named `my_project`, run the following command:

```
PyBlueprintMaker my_project basic
```
